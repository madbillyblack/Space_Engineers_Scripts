UNIVERSAL SHIP ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (USAP)
****************************************

A multi functional script for managing inventories and activating remote timers, that can be adapted to several ship configurations.

This script is a composite of several of my previous scripts, including the Miner Helper and the Munitions Loader scripts.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
The current version of the script may or may not be functional. (YMMV)
